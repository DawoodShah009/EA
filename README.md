It is an algorithm  to solve optimization problems based on Darwin's evolutionary theory.
Two pictures are there; a small one and a large one. The program takes the small picture and finds its place in the large picture.
Several genetics algorithms like crossover and mutation have been used.
It contains a report which has the details of all the experimental setups and experiments that were performed during the project.
